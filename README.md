# tkinterDnD
A nice wrapper around the tkdnd package. No tcl installation, no build is required, just download and use it! (Nevertheless, I recommend having tcl installed üòâÔ∏è)

### Install
The Pypi name is python-tkdnd, because tkinterDnD was already taken, but you can import it with `import tkinterDnD`

```
pip install python-tkdnd
```
or
```
pip3 install python-tkdnd
```

There's also an example program on how to use drag from and drop to events\
